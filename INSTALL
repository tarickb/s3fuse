Building s3fuse
===============

From a Distribution Tarball
---------------------------

To build from a distribution tarball (s3fuse-*.tar.gz):

  ./configure
  make
  make install

Working Copies
--------------

To build a working copy in the source directory:

  ./build.sh

build.sh will invoke "autoreconf" to build the configure scripts, then call 
"./configure", then call "make".

Debian Packages
---------------

To build a Debian package (.deb):

  ./make-deb.sh <output-directory>

RPMs
----

To build an RPM:

  ./make-rpm.sh <rpm-top-level-dir>

The top-level directory should contain directories named RPMS, SRPMS, SOURCES, 
SPECS, and BUILD.

Installing s3fuse
=================

To install (after building a working copy):

  make install

See README for notes on configuring s3fuse.
